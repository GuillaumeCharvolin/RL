# Reinforcement Learning Course - TP1, TP2, TP3

This repository contains the solutions and implementations for the exercises (TPs) completed in a reinforcement learning course. The project covers key topics in RL such as exploration vs exploitation, credit assignment, and Q-learning, using Python and the Gym library for practical examples.

## Topics Covered

### TP1: Exploration vs Exploitation
In this TP, we implemented strategies to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action) in reinforcement learning problems. The exercise demonstrates the trade-offs and challenges of finding an optimal policy in uncertain environments.

### TP2: Credit Assignment
This exercise focuses on the credit assignment problem in RL, where the goal is to correctly assign credit to actions based on delayed rewards. We implemented algorithms to help the agent understand which actions lead to positive or negative outcomes over time.

### TP3: Q-learning on Gym Environment
In this part, we applied Q-learning to solve a problem in the OpenAI Gym environment. The agent learns an optimal policy by interacting with the environment and updating its Q-values based on the observed rewards, demonstrating the power of model-free reinforcement learning.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for the implementation.
- **Gym**: An open-source toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, used for the environment simulations.
- **NumPy**: Used for efficient array operations in the algorithm implementations.
